# CEQUALW2-FPV

THIS IS A DRAFT AVAILABE ONLY FOR THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS

These files were created by Evan Bredeweg as data processing for the AquaPV project at Oregon State University. They include scripts that were used to integrate with CE-QUAL-W2 models for this specific use case. There are functions and approaches that can be generalized for other integration with CE-QUAL-W2, but that was not the primary focus of this work. As such, this repository has not been developed into a more user-friendly library.

R code was written in Rstudio and is the recommended application for this code.

Questions about the data or script can be directed to Evan Bredeweg, PhD.
