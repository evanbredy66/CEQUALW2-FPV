DETAILS OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT ARE AVALIABLE IN OUR ASSOCIATED PAPER IN LIMNOLOGICA:
<br>Bredeweg, E.M., Arismendi, I., Murphy, C.A., Henkel S.K. 2025. Modeling diverse environmental responses of reservoirs to floating photovoltaic systems. <i>Limnologica</i> 115: 126293. DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2025.126293">10.1016/j.limno.2025.126293</a></br>

These files were created by Evan Bredeweg as data processing for the AquaPV project at Oregon State University. They include scripts that were used to integrate with CE-QUAL-W2 models for this specific use case. There are functions and approaches that can be generalized for other integration with CE-QUAL-W2, but that was not the primary focus of this work. As such, this repository has not been developed into a more user-friendly library.

R code was written in Rstudio and is the recommended application for this code.

Questions about the data or script can be directed to Evan Bredeweg, PhD.
